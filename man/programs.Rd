\title{Find cell clusters and retrieve significant expresion programs}
\usage{
programs(
  m,
  nsig1 = 50,
  nsig2 = 10,
  jaccard = 0.7,
  p = 0.01,
  lfc = log2(2),
  pmethod = "BH"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{expression matrix of genes by cells. not row-centered}

\item{nsig1}{minimum number of genes with p-value 'p' to keep a cluster. Default: 50}

\item{nsig2}{number of genes with p-value 'p'/10. Default: 10}

\item{jaccard}{allowed jaccard similarity between clusters of cells. Default: 0.7}

\item{p}{DEA adjusted p value for genes. Default: 0.01}

\item{lfc}{DEA log2-FC value for genes. Default: log2(2)}

\item{pmethod}{adjust method. Default: 'BH'}
}
\value{
The cell clusters, their gene expression profiles (all genes log2-foldchanges), their top DE genes (n = nsig1) and their p-values are all returned.
}
\description{
Cell clusters are filtered on the basis of size, their corresponding expression programs are subsequently filtered on the basis of number of genes with sufficiently high fold-change values and sufficiently small p-values, and lastly filtered on the basis of sufficiently low jaccard similarity between any two pairs of cell clusters, whereby the cell cluster with a larger number of significant genes is kept.
