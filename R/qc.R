#' @title Fraction of a Cell's Expression Level Coming From Mitochondrial Genes 
#' @description Often used as a QC parameter for cells in scRNA-seq data. The higher the fraction of mitochondrial expression (i.e. of expression coming from mitochondrial genes), the higher the implied level of stress a cell is in and by consequence the lower the assumed quality. In scRNAseq cancer data, a cutoff of 0.25 is often used although any individual value is always arbitrary and one is better off plotting the data. note: the list of mitochondrial genes are those that start with "MT".

#' @title Expression level of Housekeeping Genes 
#' @description Often used as a QC parameter for cells in scRNA-seq data. The lower the expression level of housekeeping the genes, the more DNA contamination it suggests for the sample. In scRNAseq cancer data, this value is also used as a cutoff: e.g. a logTPM value >= 2.5 in order for a cell to be retained as HQ and with minimal DNA contamination. note: the list of housekeeping genes is taken from Normal_Markers$Housekeeping

#' @title log-Average expression of genes across all cells
#' @description Often used as a QC parameter for genes in scRNA-seq data, usually once the LQ cells have been removed. The matrix is converted to TPM space from logTPM (more specifically, from log2(TPM/10 + 1)), gene averages are calculated and finally the values are converted back to log2(TPM + 1), without dividing by 10 since the data is now simulated bulk.
